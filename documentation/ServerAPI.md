GarageServerIO.getPlayers() : [, {id, state, [, inputs], [, {states, executionTimes}]}]
```
**_Returns:_ array**  

Returns a list of all players, their current states, inputs to be processed, and a list of their prior states and times limited by the server `options.maxHistorySecondBuffer`.  

`id` **string**  
Id of the player.  
`state` **object literal**  
Current state of the player.  
`inputs` **array of object literals**  
List of all the inputs received for this player that need to be processed.  
`stateHistory` **array of object literals**  
List of all previous states and their execution times up to `options.maxHistorySecondBuffer`.
#### getEntities
---

GarageServerIO.getEntities() : [,{id, state, [, {state, executionTime }]}]
```
**_Returns:_ array**

Id of the entity.  
`state` **object literal**

#### updatePlayerState
---
```js
GarageServerIO.updatePlayerState(id, state)

Notify GarageServer.IO of a new state with an id of the player to be updated.  The idea here is that this call is made during each pass of the physics loop on the server.

Id of the player whose state should be updated.  
`state` **object literal**  
New state of the entity containing all of the properties specific to a player for your game - x, y, z, time, etc., whatever you want to add to it.  
#### updateEntityState
---
```js
GarageServerIO.updateEntityState(id, state)
```

Notify GarageServer.IO of a new state with an id of the entity to be updated.  The idea here is that this call is made during each pass of the physics loop on the server.  

`id` **string**

`state` **object literal**  
New state of the entity containing all of the properties specific to an entity for your game - x, y, z, time, etc., whatever you want to add to it.  
#### addEntity
---
```js
GarageServerIO.addEntity(id, referrerId)
```

Notify GarageServer.IO that a new entity has been added to the game.  

`id` **string**  
Id of the entity to be added.

Notify GarageServer.IO that an entity has been removed from the game.  

`id` **string**  
Id of the entity to be removed.  
#### sendPlayerEvent
---
```js
GarageServerIO.sendPlayerEvent(id, data)
```
Allows server to broadcast events to a specific player.  Use this to make custom calls to a GarageServer.IO client for your game.  
`id` **string**  
Id of the player to receive event.  
`data` **object literal**  
Object containing all properties specific to the custom event.  
#### sendPlayersEvent
---
```js
GarageServerIO.sendPlayersEvent(data)
```
Allows server to broadcast events to all players.  Use this to make custom calls to GarageServer.IO clients for your game.  
`data` **object literal**  
Object containing all properties specific to the custom event.
#### setPlayerRegion
---
```js
GarageServerIO.setPlayerRegion(id, region)
```
Sets the player region.  GarageServer.IO will broadcast the state of players and entities who share the same region.  NOTE: This will implicitly enable GarageServer.IO region broadcasting - only those players and entities with regions with be notified of state.  Use `clearRegions` to revert region broadcasting.  
`id` **string**  
Id of the player to receive event.  
`region` **string**  
Name of the region.  
#### setEntityRegion
---
```js
GarageServerIO.setEntityRegion(id, region)
```
Sets the entity region.  GarageServer.IO will broadcast the state of players and entities who share the same region.  NOTE: This will implicitly enable GarageServer.IO region broadcasting - only those players and entities with regions with be notified of state.  Use `clearRegions` to revert region broadcasting.  
`id` **string**  
Id of the entity to receive event.  
`region` **string**  
Name of the region.  
#### clearRegions
---
```js
GarageServerIO.clearRegions()
```
Clears all regions associated with players and entities.  GarageServer.IO will default back to broadcasting state to all players.
